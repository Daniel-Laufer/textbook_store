# The Textbook Exchanger
An online marketplace that facilitates the process of textbooks amongst students at the University of Toronto. Users are able to create postings about textbooks that they intend to sell, and other users are then able to search for these textbooks and contact the seller if they are interested. In addition to its many core features, it also allows users to keep track of specific posts in a personal ‘cart’, allows users to customize their profiles, supports dark mode across the entire website, and much more. I created this app because I was really interested in learning more about web development and at the same time, I also wanted to solve the problem of students having to pay ridiculous prices for their textbooks from university bookstores by providing students with a simple and accessible way to exchange textbooks amongst each other.<br/>

## Tech Stack

**Front-end:** React.js

**Back-end:**  Node.js, Express.js, firebase-admin-node, Firestore

**Deployment/Cloud:** Firebase



*This project is not intended to be run locally as it relies on having read/write access to my Fireabse project's Firestore DB which requires having my Firebase private credentials (revealing thse credentials on GitHub is obviously a bad idea). So that is why I do not have instructions on running this app locally.*
